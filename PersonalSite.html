        <h1><br><br>Hello User! My name is Raul and here is my personal website!</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
            <p>Well, i created this website beacuse i think it might be a much more simpler way of describing myself and showing off my qualities. I believe it is a fun way to present myself to the masses through a fun project. This website will be a short description of me and also a walkthrough through the projects i realised.<br>But some of you will say:"Well, isn't this just a CV?". Well yes, but we can both agree that this is more pleasant to read than a normal CV. One more thing is that for the projects you have the GitHub link in this website, so if you want to test them you can just go on and look at them for yourself. That saves me the trouble of explaining what every projects is about and how it works.</p>

            </div>
            <p>My name is Capra Marius Raul and i live in a small town in Romania. I like web development and programing in general. Also, i have a passion for mathemathics and a passion for physics. I first started programing in highschool where i learnt about C++ and programing in general. I didn't know i liked it so much at first tho, but i was realy good at it and i started to enjoy it a lot. At first I didn't even considered this option for a career as i was 100% sure i was going to become a doctor, but as highschool went by i started to like to write code more and more. By eleventh grade i gravitated more towards informatics and programing and the doctor dream was replaced with the dream of becoming a programmer. But, I didn't even know what I was going to pick. At first i tried game development, as I was watching a lot of Youtube and I was mesmerised by what you can do with code and imagination. I tried it and I really liked it, but after some time I wanted to try something else. My second visit was web development. I saw how my favorite pages were created and how just with some code you can create something that is really useful and looks very good. After that i moved on to arduino. Which I have to say I really enjoyed, but I slowly moved away from that aswell. As my final field that I was researching was Data Science and Machine Learning. It was really fascinating seeing how you can train a model to do various things. i marveled at the things AI could do and all the tasks that could be automated. In the end I had to pick something and i looked at everything and i asked myself what I enjoyed the most. It truns out web development was the way for me and i don't have second thoughts.</p>

            <h2>Alrigth, but what do you know?</h2>
            <p>Like I said, I started programing with C++ more exactly the stdio.h library. I believe highschool informatics taught me all the right algorithms and how to think a problem so I can solve it with the computer. Also at school I got my bases in HTML and a tad bit of CSS, but these are skills that i worked on more myself. Also, I learned Javascript by myself using websites and one book that i bought. Back to school related things, in school I learnt SQL and how to create databases and PHP aswell. On my own, I did a little bit of Unity when i tried game development and I enrolled in one of their free courses which was really exciting to take part. Also, I learnt the basics of Python with a course on YouTube and a book. And finally I learnt a bit of arduino with a book and online using various websites. I would say that right now the languages i feel most comforatble in are C++ , HTMl, CSS and Javascript.</p>

            <h2>What are some other hobbies that you are enjoying in your free time?</h2>
            <p>I like to play a lot of video games, as that was my obssesion when I was younger. I played a lot from shooters to survival games and even strategy games. I really like to play basketball. I was presented to it in middle school and i have to say that it was love at first sight. I really enjoyed it and i still play today from time to time. Some other things that i like are music and movies. I like all kinds of music from R&B to rap, rock and even clasical music. The same thing i can say about movies. I like all genres but my favorite ones are SF, Action, and to some extend horror. My favorite movie at the moment is the first "Matrix" movie. I know really typical for a programmer but what can i say, it hits home.</p>

            <h2>What is you work and education background?</h2>
            <p>Every school that i went to is situated in my hometown. I learnt and i am still learning at the national college "Grigore Moisil" from Urziceni. This is where I learnt and where I am learning right now in highschool. As for work background I haven't have gotten yet my first job. As I am still in high school and in my final year I am focusing on learning for my exams and trying to get in a good university where I can continue my studies.</p>
